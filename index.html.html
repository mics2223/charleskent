                  <pre>
                    Every night in my dreams
                    I see you, I feel you
                    That is how I know you go on
                    Far across the distance
                    And spaces between us 
                    You have come to show you go on
                    Near, far, wherever you are <br>
                    I believe that the heart does go on
                    Once more, you open the door
                    And you're here in my heart
                    And my heart will go on and on<br>
                    Love can touch us one time
                    And last for a lifetime
                    And never let go 'til we're gone<br>
                    Love was when I loved you
                    One true time I'd hold to
                    In my life, we'll always go on
                    Near, far, wherever you are<br>
                    I believe that the heart does go on
                     (why does the heart go on?)
                    Once more, you open the door
                    And you're here in my heart
                    And my heart will go on and on<br>
                    You're here, there's nothing I fear
                    And I know that my heart will go on
                    We'll stay forever this way
                    You are safe in my heart and
                    My heart will go on and on
                  </pre>
