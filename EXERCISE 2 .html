  <h1> GROWTH AND YIELD PERFORMANCE OF DIFFERENT SWEET PEPPER VARITIES GROWN CONDITION</h1>
  <h2> CHAPTER 1</h2>
  <h3> INTRODUCTION </h3>
  <h4> Nature and Importance of the study</h4>
    
<body> 
  <p> Vegetables rank among the most widely grown crops in the developing countries. In terms of value, vegetable production ranks even higher than all root crops and grain legumes (Knott, 1967).
    
  </p>
  <p> Among the economically important fruit vegetable is sweet pepper (Capsicum annum) L.). This crop belongs to the family Solanacea or Night shade family. It is one of the most widely grown vegetables in all regions in the Philippines. The crop rich vitamin A and C, niacin, riboflavin and thiamine (Brickel, 1992).
    
  </p>
  <p> Sweet pepper along with other Solanaceous crops such as eggplant, tomato and potato are called "warm-season crops", because they can be grown under relatively warm climate. Pepper is apparently more drought resistance than either tomato or eggplant, nevertheless best yield are dependent upon ample supply of well-distributed rainfall and a mean temperature at blossom setting time ranging from 18.48 to 26.88 C. (Attfield, 1993).
           
  </p>
  
  <p> Sweet pepper is usually grown in the field However, in areas where growing space is limited, this crop is grown in containers. Growing plants in containers have many advantage. They are more adoptable tom the new production programs than those field grown plants.
      
  </p>
  
  <p> Using the right cultivars of sweet pepper is also very important. Criteria for selection of appropriate cultivars/varieties to plant should include yield potential, resistance to pest and diseases and general adaptability to existing agro-climatic conditions (Basco, 1983). In sweet pepper, the different varieties are Yolo Wonder, long shape, all season variety (deep green color fruit), all season variety (plastic type yellow green color fruit), are considered good yielders and can be planted at high and low level of soil elevation. However, under Calbayog condition not all these varieties mentioned were planted under farmers fields condition, hence verification of these varieties as to their adaptability and yield performance under local condition must be determined first before venturing into massive production of any varieties identified thus, this research was conducted.
    
  </p>
 
  <h4> Objectives of the study</h4>
  <p> 1. To determine the growth and yield performance of the different sweet pepper varieties grown under Calbayog condition.
    
  </p>
  <p> 2. To determine which of the different varieties would give the optimum yield of sweet pepper fruits.
    
  </p>
  <p> 3. To determine the cost and return analysis of different varieties of sweet pepper production
    
  </p>
  
  <h4>Time and Place of the Conduct of the study</h4>
  <p> This study was conducted in the Agriculture Nursery area of TTMIST, Calbayog City from January 28, 2003 up to May 28 2003
   
  </p>
  <h4> Scope and Limitation of the study</h4>
  <p>This study focused only on the identification of the growth and yield performance of the different sweet pepper varieties grown under Calbayog City condition
