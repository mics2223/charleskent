                  <pre>
                    Every night in my dreams
                    I see you, I feel you
                    That is how I know you go on
                    Far across the distance
                    And spaces between us 
                    You have come to show you go on
                    Near, far, wherever you are <br>
                    I believe that the heart does go on
                    Once more, you open the door
                    And you're here in my heart
                    And my heart will go on and on<br>
                    Love can touch us one time
                    And last for a lifetime
                    And never let go 'til we're gone<br>
                    Love was when I loved you
                    One true time I'd hold to
                    In my life, we'll always go on
                    Near, far, wherever you are<br>
                    I believe that the heart does go on
                     (why does the heart go on?)
                    Once more, you open the door
                    And you're here in my heart
                    And my heart will go on and on<br>
                    You're here, there's nothing I fear
                    And I know that my heart will go on
                    We'll stay forever this way
                    You are safe in my heart and
                    My heart will go on and on
                  </pre>

                     <li> "My Heart Will Go On" is about the undying love between Rose and Jack from the movie Titanic, a love so strong that it transcends even death and distance.</li>

                     <li> From the perspective of an elderly Rose, the lyrics express the enduring nature of their bond, the continuation of life, and the belief in a spiritual connection that keeps their love alive and assures a future reunion beyond the physical world.  </li>

                <h2>EXERCISES REFLECTION</h2>
                <p>Completing the lesson on adding lists, images, videos, and audio to HTML was challenging but very rewarding. It required patience and practice, but I stayed determined and successfully added all these elements to my work. I’m proud of myself for pushing through the difficulties and achieving my goal. This activity taught me how important perseverance and attention to detail are in web development. I’m excited to keep learning and creating more engaging content.
